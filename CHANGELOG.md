## [0.7.7] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Multi-agent installer** (closes [#137](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph/issues/137)).
  `codegraph install` now opens with a multi-select prompt for **Claude Code**,
  **Cursor**, **Codex CLI**, and **opencode** — detected agents are pre-checked.
  Each writes its native MCP config + instructions file (e.g. `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
  + `.cursor/rules/codegraph.mdc`, `~/.codex/config.toml` + `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`,
  `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`). The runtime MCP server was already
  agent-agnostic; this brings the installer to parity.
- Non-interactive install flags for scripting / CI:
  `--target=<csv|auto|all|none>`, `--location=<global|local>`, `--yes`,
  `--no-permissions`, `--print-config <id>`.
- `codegraph init` now auto-wires project-local agent surfaces for any agent
  configured globally. In practice: Cursor's `.cursor/rules/codegraph.mdc`
  is dropped on `init` so a single global `codegraph install` works in every
  project you open — no per-project re-install needed.

### Fixed
- **Cursor**: globally-installed codegraph reported "not initialized" in every
  workspace because Cursor launches MCP-server subprocesses with the wrong
  working directory and doesn't pass `rootUri` in the MCP initialize call.
  We now inject `--path` into Cursor's MCP args — absolute path for local
  installs, `${workspaceFolder}` for global installs.

### Changed
- Agent-instructions template is now agent-agnostic. The previous template was
  inherited from the Claude-only era and prescribed "spawn an Explore agent" —
  a Claude Code-specific concept that confused Cursor's and Codex's agents and
  caused them to fall back to native grep even with codegraph available. The
  new template adds explicit "trust codegraph results, don't re-verify with
  grep" guidance and a clear tool-by-question matrix. Applies to
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/codegraph.mdc`, and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`.
- `codegraph install` prompt order: agent picker is now step 1, before the
  PATH-install and location prompts.
- Disambiguated "global" wording in install prompts ("Install codegraph CLI on
  your PATH?" vs "Apply agent configs to all your projects, or just this one?")
  — both used to say "Global" and read as duplicates.

### Internal
- New `AgentTarget` interface in `src/installer/targets/` — adding a 5th agent
  (Continue, Zed, Windsurf, …) is a new file + one entry in `registry.ts`.
- Hand-rolled TOML serializer for Codex (`src/installer/targets/toml.ts`) — no
  new dependency, scoped to the `[mcp_servers.codegraph]` table only, sibling
  tables and `[[array_of_tables]]` preserved verbatim.
- +47 parameterized contract tests across the 4 targets — install idempotency,
  sibling preservation, uninstall reverses install, byte-equal re-runs return
  `unchanged`, partial-state recovery for Codex.

Thank you.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- `codegraph` CLI failing with `zsh: permission denied: codegraph` after a fresh
  global install. The published 0.7.5 tarball shipped `dist/bin/codegraph.js`
  without the executable bit, so the shell refused to run it through the npm
  symlink. The build now `chmod +x`'s the binary before packing.

  Already on 0.7.5? Either upgrade to 0.7.6, or unblock yourself in place:
  ```bash
  chmod +x "$(npm root -g)/@colbymchenry/codegraph/dist/bin/codegraph.js"
  ```
